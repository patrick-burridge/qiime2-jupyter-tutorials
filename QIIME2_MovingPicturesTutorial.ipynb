The result of both of these methods will be a ``FeatureTable[Frequency]`` QIIME 2 artifact, which contains counts (frequencies) of each unique sequence in each sample in the dataset, and a ``FeatureData[Sequence]`` QIIME 2 artifact, which maps feature identifiers in the ``FeatureTable`` to the sequences they represent.\n",

After creating these artifacts you'll rename the artifacts from one of the two options to more generic filenames (e.g., ``table.qza``). This process of creating a specific name for an artifact and then renaming it is only done to allow you to choose which of the two options you'd like to use for this step, and then complete the tutorial without paying attention to that choice again.

This allows the user to remove low quality regions of the sequences. To determine what values to pass for these two parameters, you should review the *Interactive Quality Plot* tab in the ``demux.qzv`` file that was generated by ``qiime demux summarize`` above.\n",

Because most diversity metrics are sensitive to different sampling depths across different samples, this script will randomly subsample the counts from each sample to the value provided for this parameter. For example, if you provide ``--p-sampling-depth 500``, this step will subsample the counts in each sample without replacement so that each sample in the resulting table has a total count of 500. If the total count for any sample(s) are smaller than this value, those samples will be dropped from the diversity analysis. Choosing this value is tricky.

This will allow us to retain most of our samples. The three samples that have fewer sequences will be dropped from the ``core-metrics-phylogenetic`` analyses and anything that uses these results. It is worth noting that all three of these samples are \"right palm\" samples. Losing a disproportionate number of samples from one metadata category is not ideal.

If you call this command with the ``--p-pairwise`` parameter, as we'll do here, it will also perform pairwise tests that will allow you to determine which specific pairs of groups (e.g., tongue and gut) differ from one another, if any. This command can be slow to run, especially when passing ``--p-pairwise``, since it is based on permutation tests. So, unlike the previous commands, we'll run ``beta-group-significance`` on specific columns of metadata that we're interested in exploring, rather than all metadata columns to which it is applicable.

    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll explore alpha diversity as a function of sampling depth using the ``qiime diversity alpha-rarefaction`` visualizer. This visualizer computes one or more alpha diversity metrics at multiple sampling depths, in steps between 1 (optionally controlled with ``--p-min-depth``) and the value provided as ``--p-max-depth``. At each sampling depth step, 10 rarefied tables will be generated, and the diversity metrics will be computed for all samples in the tables. The number of iterations (rarefied tables computed at each sampling depth) can be controlled with ``--p-iterations``. Average diversity values will be plotted for each sample at each even sampling depth, and samples can be grouped based on metadata in the resulting visualization if sample metadata is provided with the ``--m-metadata-file`` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization will have two plots. The top plot is an alpha rarefaction plot, and is primarily used to determine if the richness of the samples has been fully observed or sequenced. If the lines in the plot appear to \"level out\" (i.e., approach a slope of zero) at some sampling depth along the x-axis, that suggests that collecting additional sequences beyond that sampling depth would not be likely to result in the observation of additional features. If the lines in a plot don't level out, this may be because the richness of the samples hasn't been fully observed yet (because too few sequences were collected), or it could be an indicator that a lot of sequencing error remains in the data (which is being mistaken for novel diversity).\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom plot in this visualization is important when grouping samples by metadata. It illustrates the number of samples that remain in each group when the feature table is rarefied to each sampling depth. If a given sampling depth ``d`` is larger than the total frequency of a sample ``s`` (i.e., the number of sequences that were obtained for sample ``s``), it is not possible to compute the diversity metric for sample ``s`` at sampling depth ``d``. If many of the samples in a group have lower total frequencies than ``d``, the average diversity presented for that group at ``d`` in the top plot will be unreliable because it will have been computed on relatively few samples. When grouping samples by metadata, it is therefore essential to look at the bottom plot to ensure that the data presented in the top plot is reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "    The value that you provide for ``--p-max-depth`` should be determined by reviewing the \"Frequency per sample\" information presented in the ``table.qzv`` file that was created above. In general, choosing a value that is somewhere around the median frequency seems to work well, but you may want to increase that value if the lines in the resulting rarefaction plot don't appear to be leveling out, or decrease that value if you seem to be losing many of your samples due to low total frequencies closer to the minimum sampling depth than the maximum sampling depth.\n",

    "    When grouping samples by \"body-site\" and viewing the alpha rarefaction plot for the \"observed_otus\" metric, which body sites (if any) appear to exhibit sufficient diversity coverage (i.e., their rarefaction curves level off)? How many sequence variants appear to be present in those body sites?\n",
    "\n",
    ".. question::\n",
    "    When grouping samples by \"body-site\" and viewing the alpha rarefaction plot for the \"observed_otus\" metric, the line for the \"right palm\" samples appears to level out at about 40, but then jumps to about 140. What do you think is happening here? (Hint: be sure to look at both the top and bottom plots.)"

The first step in this process is to assign taxonomy to the sequences in our ``FeatureData[Sequence]`` QIIME 2 artifact. We'll do that using a pre-trained Naive Bayes classifier and the ``q2-feature-classifier`` plugin. This classifier was trained on the Greengenes 13_8 99% OTUs, where the sequences have been trimmed to only include 250 bases from the region of the 16S that was sequenced in this analysis (the V4 region, bound by the 515F/806R primer pair).

    "-----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "ANCOM can be applied to identify features that are differentially abundant (i.e. present in different abundances) across sample groups. As with any bioinformatics method, you should be aware of the assumptions and limitations of ANCOM before using it. We recommend reviewing the `ANCOM paper`_ before using this method. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26028277\n",

    "   Differential abundance testing in microbiome analysis is an active area of research. There are two QIIME 2 plugins that can be used for this: ``q2-gneiss`` and ``q2-composition``.

    "\n",
    "ANCOM is implemented in the ``q2-composition`` plugin. ANCOM assumes that few (less than about 25%) of the features are changing between groups. If you expect that more features are changing between your groups, you should not use ANCOM as it will be more error-prone (an increase in both Type I and Type II errors is possible). Because we expect a lot of features to change in abundance across body sites, in this tutorial we'll filter our full feature table to only contain gut samples. We'll then apply ANCOM to determine which, if any, sequence variants and genera are differentially abundant across the gut samples of our two subjects.\n",
